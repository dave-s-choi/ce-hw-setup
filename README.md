===========

quick and dirty scripts for creating small files from consumer expenditure survey suitable for short assignments

assumes scripts by ajdamico have been run to download CE microdata and convert to R format from
https://github.com/ajdamico/usgsd/tree/master/Consumer%20Expenditure%20Survey

also uses code from 2011_fmly_analysis_example.R by same person. All this would be much harder without his 
work, which is on http://www.asdfree.com/search/label/consumer%20expenditure%20survey%20%28ce%29
